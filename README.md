# BIODS Final
# Project Description
This program is being created as part of the Stanford class BIODS 253: Software Engineering for Scientists by Stanford Bioengineering graduate student Scott Piper (sjpiper@stanford.edu) in Winter quarter 2022. This class has covered the basics of software engineering and how to write clean, usable code in a collaborative environment. Highlighted topics include testing, source control, variable naming, defining functions, and writing descriptive code.

The content from this program is inspired by a problem set from the Stanford class BIOE 217: Translational Bioinformatics. This problem set uses data from a digital health paper to analyze airplane travel’s affect on sleeping patterns using wearables (Li, X., Dunn, J., Salins, D., Zhou, G., Zhou, W., Rose, S. M. S. F., ... & Sonecha, R. (2017). Digital health: tracking physiomes and activity using wearable biosensors reveals useful health-related information. PLoS biology, 15(1), e2001402). The program consists of reading in wearable data, extracting sleeping events, categorizing them as affected by a flight or not, and then comparing the two groups. The original problem set was for one participant in the study, but by adapting the code from the Jupyter Notebook problem set into a python program, it will be more easily applied to more participants.

# How to Use
This program can be run from the command line. This program takes two input arguments. The first should be the csv file containing the sleep data from the wearable with columns 'start_time_iso' with GMT date and time of the sleep starting and 'actual_minutes' with sleep duration in minutes. The second should be the csv file containing the activity data from the wearable with columns 'Start' with GMT date and time of activity start, 'Duration' with activity duration in seconds, 'Distance' with distance travelled in miles, and 'Activity' with an activity type label. This program was written on Python 3.

An example of how to run the program from the command line would be: python3 sleep_analysis.py --sleep_data_csv sleep.csv --activity_data_csv activities.csv

Run 'python3 sleep_analysis.py -h' on the command line for more information.

# Program Design
A library (sleep_analysis_lib.py) was created with the necessary functions to process the wearable data. First, some basic supporting functions are created. These include functions to read the input data, calculate basic statistics, draw a histogram, and calculate Cohen's d. The first main function, sleep_processing, takes the sleep data and determines how many hours of sleep the subject got on each day. A histogram is returned and basic stats are calculated. The second main function takes activity data and determines the date and duration of flights taken by the subject. This is done using activities labeled as ‘airplane’ or those labele 'transport' with speeds between 100 and 700 mph. A histogram and basic stats are created here as well. The third main funciton determines which dates were affected by airline travel and daily sleep is separated into either flight-affected sleep or non flight-affected sleep. A histogram and t-test are delivered to compare the two groups. Additionally, Cohen’s d is found to analyze the effect size of airline travel on sleep.

A command line interface (sleep_analysis_cli.py) was created to allow the user to run these functions while inputting data from the terminal. Unittests were created for all of the major functions (sleep_analysis_unittests.py) along with test data.
