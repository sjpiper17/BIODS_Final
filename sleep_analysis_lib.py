#This library is meant to analyze airplane travel's effect on sleep duration using wearable device data. It 
#is being completed as part of the Stanford class BIODS 253: Software Engineering for Scientists 
#by Stanford Bioengineering graduate student Scott Piper (sjpiper@stanford.edu) in Winter quarter 2022.
#The content from this program is inspired by a problem set from the Stanford class BIOE 217: Translational Bioinformatics.
#Data comes from this research paper: Li, X., Dunn, J., Salins, D., Zhou, G., Zhou, W., Rose, S. M. S. F., ... & Sonecha, R. (2017). 
#Digital health: tracking physiomes and activity using wearable biosensors reveals useful health-related information. PLoS biology,
# 15(1), e2001402

#This program can be run from the command line interface and takes two input arguments. The first should be the csv file containing 
#the sleep data. The second should be the csvfile containing the activity data. To run the functions on the provided data, use 
#'python3 sleep_analysis_cli.py --sleep_data_csv sleep_to_03-31-16.csv --activity_data_csv activities.csv'. Run 
#'python3 sleep_analysis_cli.py -h' for more information.

    rides, train rides, etc. We will define a flight as an activity that is either (labeled `airplane`) OR (labeled `transport` AND has an 
    average speed over 100 miles/hour). You can calculate speed from `Duration` (given in seconds) and `Distance` (given in miles). Additionally, 
    the fastest commercial flights run at around 660 mph. Therefore, we also filter out activities that are over 700 mph to avoid any measurements
